        Our Mission
      </h4>
      <p>
        A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my 
        entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring 
        which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, 
        and feel the charm of existence in this spot, 
        which was created for the bliss of souls like 
        mine.
