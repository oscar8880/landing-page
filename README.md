# Shift.io landing page

### A vanilla javascript project

For this project I created a landing page for a fictional business, Shift.io. 

Go to https://oscar8880.github.io/landing-page/ to view the site.

The key learning points were:
* Using Javascript to build interactivity into websites
* Dynamically adding content with JS
* Improving UX with JS
